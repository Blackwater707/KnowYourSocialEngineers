    <h3>TYPE ANSWERS IN CAPITAL LETTERS</h3>

        <p>Imagine an office worker, Alex, finding a sleek USB drive labeled "Executive Bonuses 2025" on their desk one morning. Curious and unable to resist the temptation, they plug the USB into their workstation. What Alex doesn't realize is that the device contains malware meticulously designed to breach the company’s security. The attacker, well aware of the office dynamics and Alex's curiosity, strategically left the bait after overhearing employees grumbling about lack of raises. The promise of confidential information, coupled with the element of exclusivity, made Alex the perfect target. This single moment of indulgence gave the attacker access to not only sensitive company data but also the personal information of hundreds of employees, all with a simple act of curiosity</p>

        <p>Jessica received a call from someone claiming to be an investigator from her insurance company. The caller provided plausible details about a recent car accident she had reported—a case she had discussed with only a few individuals. To Jessica, the voice on the other end sounded sympathetic yet professional, asking her to confirm personal details “to process her claim faster.” What Jessica didn’t know was that this caller was no investigator but a fraudster who had pieced together fragments of publicly available information combined with stolen snippets from other sources. By the time Jessica started suspecting the caller, it was too late—the fraudster now had access to her identity and other critical information. The fabrication of trust and credibility, laced with urgency, was the perfect pretext to exploit her.</p>

        <p>Chris, a college student and aspiring musician, had recently started an online friendship with someone named Taylor. Taylor, claiming to be a well-connected music producer, showered Chris with promises of record deals and fame. Over weeks, Taylor built a rapport, discussing music, offering advice, and sharing what seemed like insider knowledge of the industry. Eventually, Taylor told Chris about an exclusive opportunity to secure a deal with a major label but needed "commitment funds" to show seriousness to the label executives. Chris, driven by ambition and trust, transferred the requested money. Weeks later, when Taylor vanished without a trace, Chris realized the profile had been entirely fabricated—a textbook case of emotional exploitation and deception.</p>
